This document serves as a guide for AI agents and developers working on the Martin Tech Labs website. It outlines the project structure, tech stack, design system, and development conventions.

## 1. Project Overview

Martin Tech Labs is a fractional CTO service provider helping early-stage founders ship products fast and scale engineering teams. The website is a static single-page application (SPA) designed to showcase services, case studies, and expertise.

## 2. Tech Stack

-   **Framework:** React 19 (via Vite)
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
-   **UI Library:** shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)

-   **Icons:** Lucide React
-   **Deployment:** Vercel (Static Export)

## 3. Project Structure

  /src
    /components     # Reusable UI components
      /ui           # shadcn/ui primitives (Button, Card, etc.)
      Header.tsx    # Global navigation header
      Footer.tsx    # Global footer
      Testimonials.tsx # Testimonial carousel
    /pages          # Page-level components

      Services.tsx  # Detailed services page
      /case-studies # Individual case study pages
    /lib            # Utility functions (cn, etc.)
    App.tsx         # Main application component & routing
    index.css       # Global styles & Tailwind directives
    main.tsx        # Entry point
```

## 4. Design System

### Colors
-   **Primary:** Blue/Cyan (Tech-focused, trustworthy)
-   **Background:** Dark/Black (Modern, high-end tech aesthetic)
-   **Foreground:** Light/White (High contrast for readability)
-   **Accents:** Muted grays for borders and secondary text

### Typography
-   **Font Family:** Inter (Sans-serif) & JetBrains Mono (Monospace for headers/accents)
-   **Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between headings (Mono) and body text (Sans).

### Components
-   **Buttons:** `default` (Solid Primary), `outline` (Bordered), `ghost` (Text only)
-   **Cards:** Used heavily for services, case studies, and testimonials.
-   **Badges:** Used for tags and highlights.

## 5. Key Features & Implementation Details

### Navigation
-   **Header:** Responsive component with a mobile drawer menu.
-   **Routing:** Uses `wouter` for client-side routing.
-   **Hash Scrolling:** `Home.tsx` includes a custom `useEffect` hook to handle hash links (e.g., `/#about`) correctly when navigating from other pages.

### Case Studies
-   Located in `/client/src/pages/case-studies/`.
-   Each case study follows a consistent layout: Challenge, Solution, Results, and Technical Details.

### Assets
-   Images are stored in `/client/public/images/`.
-   **Logo:** `/images/logo.webp`
-   **Favicon:** `/favicon.ico`

## 6. Development Workflow

1.  **Install Dependencies:** `npm install` or `pnpm install`
2.  **Start Dev Server:** `npm run dev`
3.  **Build for Production:** `npm run build`

## 7. Deployment

The project is configured for Vercel.
-   **Build Command:** `npm run build`
-   **Output Directory:** `dist`
-   **Configuration:** `vercel.json` handles rewrites for SPA routing (directing all requests to `index.html`).

## 8. Future Improvements (To-Do)

-   [ ] **Blog:** Add a blog section for technical insights.
-   [ ] **Newsletter:** Integrate an email capture form.
-   [ ] **SEO:** Enhance meta tags and Open Graph data for better social sharing.
-   [ ] **Analytics:** Integrate a privacy-focused analytics tool.
